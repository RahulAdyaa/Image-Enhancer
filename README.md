📌 Step 1: Clone the Repository
To download the project, open your terminal and run:

📌 Step 4: Configure the API
This project requires an API key for proper functionality.

Navigate to the config.js file and update it with your API details:

js
Copy
Edit
export const config = {
    PICKWISH_API_KEY: "your_api_key_here",  // Replace with your actual API key

    MAXIMUM_RETRIES: 3  // Set the maximum number of retry attempts
};
🔹 PICKWISH_API_KEY → Your API key for image enhancement.
🔹 BASE_URL → The API's base URL for sending requests.
🔹 MAXIMUM_RETRIES → The number of times the app will retry if a request fails.

💡 Tip: Keep your API key secure by storing it in an .env file instead of hardcoding it.
